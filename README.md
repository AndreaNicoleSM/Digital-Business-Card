# Digital Business Card
 I created this card using HTML, CSS, and React.js. This is intended to be a sample mockup and therefore does not contain actual links to personal sites or social media, nor does it have a fully fleshed out About or Interests sections. This was merely a practical exercise, following along with the Scrimba React course.
